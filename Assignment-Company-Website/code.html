  			<h1> Our Code of Conduct</h1>	 
			A code of business conduct, sometimes called a code of ethics, is a management tool for setting out an organization&#039;s values, responsibilities and ethical obligations. The code of conduct provides employees with guidance for handling difficult ethical situations related to the business. Businesses develop their own codes, based on their core values, and no two codes are the same. To be truly effective, the code of conduct must also be embedded in the business, so employees know how it applies to them.
			<br>
			Developing a Code<br>
			The first step is to find out what topics employees feel they need guidance on--for example, bullying, bribery or addressing work-life balance. The code also must take into account needs of shareholders, customers, suppliers and the local community. To do this, the company can employ surveys and formal and informal discussions. The code also should include a way for employees to report violations anonymously, and a way for employees to get advice about ethical issues or concerns.
			<br>
			Effect on Employee Behavior<br>
			Having a code of ethics can lead to improved employee behavior. According to the 2009 National Business Ethics Survey, 89 percent of those polled felt management adequately discussed the importance of ethical conduct. Similarly, KPMG&#039;s 2008-2009 Integrity Survey, published by KPMG Forensic, found that ethics programs, including codes of conduct, had a strong impact on how employees felt. Ninety percent of those surveyed who worked in companies with a code of conduct felt they were motivated to "do the right thing." This compares with just 43 percent of people who work in companies without strong codes of conduct.
			<br>
			Instituting the Code<br>
			For a code of conduct to be a useful tool, it is important to introduce and endorse it at the highest levels of the business. Once the code is written, the CEO and governing body should sign off on it. Then, the company can incorporate it into orientation and training programs. Many companies require staff members to sign a document that they read and understand the code, and others require all employees to abide by the code of conduct as a condition of their employment. Many companies also use an audit or internal review to measure the effectiveness of their code.
			<br>
			Significance<br>
			A 2009 study by the Ethics Resource Center found that organizations with strong codes of conduct experience less misconduct, less failure to report misbehavior and less retaliation on the job. This improved ethical behavior can positively impact business performance. Thus, one way to view a code of conduct is as a type of preventative medicine. Without it, a business is vulnerable because it has neglected to take business ethics seriously.
			<br>
			Good Business Conduct<br>
			Codes of conduct are especially important for small and medium-sized businesses, which often rely for their success on good relationships with staff members and the local community. These businesses should develop a code which focuses on establishing and maintaining their core business values. For example, safeguarding medical records is a core value for a medical school, so Houston-based Baylor College of Medicine includes in its code of conduct, &ldquo;Make sure all business and medical records for which you are responsible are accurate and maintained as required by federal and state law.&rdquo; Codes of conduct also can ensure that all business partners share your values and support the local community.
